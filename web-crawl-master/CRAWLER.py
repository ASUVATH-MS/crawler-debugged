# Task:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generate a Web Crawler to extract elements and build a simple Site Map.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Solution:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Following Program Crawls url(s) from the seed domain and traverses through.
# It then presents a fetched url and its associated html page title and any
# unwanted external url(s). This is then passed onto a print function to display 
# the found and crawled url(s) and matches to the command GUI. The idea is to 
# crawl using BFS and present any hierarchical site map distinctions. Such as, 
# all the found url(s) from the seed, and then any external likes. The depth 
# level can be adjusted to go deeper, however, this may present problems in 
# execution and performance.

# Besides this, the implementation of the BFS algorithm is also an educational 
# experiment, to see how Breadth First crawling utilises the data structure of
# 'queues', fetching and storing pages as it traverses from "lowest level in the 
# in a graph" using comparative analysis of the lowest level by 
# "then checking neighbour nodes step by step" (Patel & Jethva, 2015) until 
# the whole graph has been traversed.
